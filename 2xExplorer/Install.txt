// INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR 2xExplorer

The steps needed to install 2xExplorer on any computer are nearly
trivial. Just use Windows Explorer (or any similar application)
to create the folder that 2xExplorer will reside (e.g. 
"C:\Program Files\2xExplorer") and copy the executable file together
with all the accompanying text files in the newly created directory.
You can add a shortcut for the application and keep it on the desktop
for easy access to 2xExplorer.


MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95
2xExplorer will run on ALL Win32 platforms, including WinNT/2000. 
(the program has been tested OK for NT4/SP4 and above)


Below is a list of the files you should find in the 2xExplorer 
archive (typically .zip file, if you have downloaded it):

NAME             DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2xExplorer.exe   The application itself
2xExplorer.rtf   The brief "help" file explaining the main features of
                 2xExplorer. It should be kept in the same folder as
                 the executable file.
Licence.txt      Please read carefully before installing 2xExplorer
Install.txt      This file
Keyboard.txt     Keyboard assignments for advanced user commands
FAQ.txt          Frequently Asked Questions that may help your query
Newest.txt       Description of the latest version release
registry.txt     Registry settings for "advanced" tweaking
ReleaseNotes.zip Packed text files containing older release notes

NOTE:
"2xExplorer.exe.manifest" should be kept in the same folder as the main
program if you use windows XP and you want the new "fancy" visual style
controls. However it is not essential and you can delete it, especially
if you prefer the traditional look.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// UN-INSTALLING 2xExplorer

The uninstall procedure is as straightforward as the installation. 
2xExplorer does not copy any files in any system directory, so in 
order to remove it you just have to delete the folder that you have 
placed it into. Advanced tweakers may also wish to remove the info
2xExplorer places in the registry: simply search within the RegEdit
for "2xExplorer" and delete the respective key; that's the only spot
used by the program.
